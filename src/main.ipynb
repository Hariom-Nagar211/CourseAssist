      "1. Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A\n",
      "force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\n",
      "2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\n",
      "arrived at the law of inertia. Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\n",
      "thus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\n",
      "unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”. In simple terms, the First Law\n",
      "is “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\n",
      "3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\n",
      "p = mv\n",
      "4. Newton’s second law of motion :\n",
      "The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\n",
      "place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus\n",
      "dp\n",
      "F =k =k m a\n",

      "The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n",
      "(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)\n",
      "(b) It is a vector equation\n",
      "(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F\n",
      "is the total external force on the system and a is the acceleration of the system as\n",
      "a whole.\n",
      "(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\n",
      "That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\n",
      "history of motion.\n",
      "4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\n",
      "The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\n",
      "measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\n",
